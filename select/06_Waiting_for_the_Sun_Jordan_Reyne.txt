Mother England lies
Where the gulf stream brings
The warm water through
She wont have the time
But take this piece of mind:
She walked the world with you

She says the same thing to me
Again and again and again
I've called and I've called and she says to me
I've called and I've called and she says to me:
She's waiting for the sun

In the eastern arm
A face with practiced charm
Is building solemn walls
In his ruined towns
The vultures do their rounds
And televise his calls
