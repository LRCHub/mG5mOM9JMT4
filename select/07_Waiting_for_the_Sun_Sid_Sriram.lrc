[00:05.18] Waiting for the sun, to fall on me
[00:16.56] Cracks all in the walls, they call for me
[00:28.98] I'm going to love you, don't run from me
[00:48.98] 
[00:52.34] It's indescribable, the way you make me feel
[01:04.08] You reach beneath the scars
[01:07.92] And cut through something real
[01:15.86] And I'm going to love you, don't run from me
