Hollow bones and empty nests
With just a song inside our chests
Just like two blackbirds there waiting for the sun
Just like two black birds waiting for the sun

And to think we reckoned
We'd be warm in summer clothes
A wind from the highways tangled up out twisted souls
A wind from the highways tangled up our twisted souls

Asked myself, "are you afraid to die?"

See my skin through holey jeans
Time's been pulling at my seams
The night times & evenings no slumber have I found
Till When I am lying 6 feet underground

But there's a special medicine
Made for people wandering
A melody you could sing until your days are done
just like two blackbirds waiting for the sun

I'm not afraid to die
