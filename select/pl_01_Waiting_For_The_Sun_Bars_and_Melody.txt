Maybe I wasn't ready
And maybe you didn't know
In night time living
my days were darker
But pain wouldn't show
I wanna hold her
I wanna see her
I promised that
I will never leave her
When my eyes closed
You're on my mind tho
When I'm with you
I don't know where the time goes
Come on hold me
I'm feeling lonely
So beautiful I don't know
why you chose me
Can I stay here?
can I fade here?
I don't know why
We've been holding so tight
Life's been passing us by
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the Sun
waiting for the sun
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the Sun
We're breathing I'm not leaving
Pain stabs from the
ceiling on okay now
Can you stay now?
Feel so below
looking for a way out
You calling in the morning
I open up my arms
and you falling
Let me stay here
will you play here?
I don't know why
We've been holding so tight
Life's been passing us by
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the Sun
waiting for the sun
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
We will be alright
all night let me know
Would you be
when I'm blind my guide
Do you want
to stay with me till sunrise
Soon we can fall
stay with me till sunrise
Oh tonight,
I think we'll be alright
Waiting for the Sun
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
Waiting for the S-u-u-u-n
We will be alright
all night let me know
Would you be
when I'm blind my guide
Do you want
to stay with me till sunrise
Soon we can fall
stay with me till sunrise
Waiting for the Sun
