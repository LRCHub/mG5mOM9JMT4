There's birth and death and a life that's in between, but what's it all supposed to mean? When everybody looks back tell me what they'll see. What was I supposed to be? A tear in the universal stream? Wake me. Shake me. Show me something real, beyond the nothing that I feel. Break me. Take me. Run me out of time. What exists between the lines? They said it was a "how" but it was a "why". Madeline woke up eary in the day, and the picture will replay. Sped up slowed down, viewed it either way, but it always lookes the same. My hands put the bullets in her brain.
I'm just waiting for the sun, and I feel the weight a ton, but untill my time is through, what was I supposed to do or say or pray to anyway? I drew it black but it was gray. A folded paper lying on the ground. She couldn't live with what I found. A note from another boy in town. One-Two-Three load the silver in the gun, and I can hear the water run. Bang Bang Bang now the water's runing red, like the devils in my head. Sleep tight darlin' on your tile bed.
I'm just waiting for the sun, and I feel the wait a ton, but untill my time is through, what was I supposed to do? I there a light that I'll walk into, and will it shine just like the sun, or will it burn me just like love?
How will you even hold yourself up? How will you walk the hall into your doom? Will you fall and beg for mercy? Will you take it like a man? And do you think that God will understand?
Visiting hours and a man is ushered in, and he tells me with a grin... the note was from her father visiting.
I'm just waiting for the sun, and I feel the weight a ton, but untill my time is through, what was I supposed to do? Is there a light that I'll walk into, and will it shine just like the sun, or will it burn just like love? And now my debt is due, I see my halo's turning blue, and now the waiting can be through
